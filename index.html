            <h3>Learning Web development as a beginner.</h3>
            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try
                to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h3>Be a dream Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.

                <p> had only basic previous background, but this helped solidify and give more understanding as to the
                    meanings of tags. Loved the quiz at the end and passed first time 100%. The explanation of how to
                    practice on your browser and create a full form really helped too.</p>

                    Whether we wake up to brush our teeth or even just to wake up we interact with their discoveries. I
                    think their inventions contributed to the development of new technology because it enhanced our
                    productivity, how we communicate and how we share information.
